# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
As a user of this app, I want to be able to share my coffee experiences with other users so that I can 
find new places or brands of coffee that I might enjoy and also make sure that I am making ethical purchasing decisions, 
not just to have a good coffee experience regarding taste.

This idea is inspired (I think) by the Untappd mobile app and Yelp. Untappd provides beer enthusiasts with a platform 
to share new brews they've discovered and track business locations of these brews so that other users can locate them and also
provide and read reviews. We thought it would be fun to do a similar concept with coffee and I thought that we could also address
a concern among many coffee fans by providing a way for users to include notes about whether the coffee beans or cafe provide
organic coffee, fairtrade coffee, sustainably sourced coffee, etc. 

### Features
App (Coffee) - Yelp for beverages: 
 Rate coffee: Implement a star-rating system, which also includes a place for users to provide written reviews, 
 And check off the options (organic, sustainably sourced, fairtrade) in check boxes to include in tags on the coffee bean 
 or cafe profile/review. The review option can also provide users with a place to upload photos of their coffee/packaging, 
 in order to help other users visually locate the beans on shelves or show off the artistic skills of the barista 
 (in the case that it's an already prepared beverage from a cafe). 
 
 Check-in: We can use Google maps to provide users with a way to check in to the cafe or shop that sells the coffee, 
 so that other users can also find the coffee and/or provide their own reviews.  
 
 User Profiles (for coffee drinkers): Coffee drinkers can fill out bios and then provide further, more relevant information
  about themselves with prompts on the form such as:
 
 "My favorite treat to eat with my coffee is. . ."
 
 "My favorite roast-type/coffee is. . ."
 
 "My favorite way to brew coffee is. . ."
 We would also like to create a points/rewards system, where users can collect points each time they upload a review for
 a new coffee product or cafe. With their points, they are rewarded at different levels with various kinds of cleverly-
 named badges, which will be displayed on their profiles. 
 Additionally, we could provide a place that showcases their latest review/photo upload/check-in (like the Goodreads "latest reviews" widget
 that you can insert into a Wordpress blog or webpage). Finally, they can upload a limited sized photo for their profile photo.
 
 Option for Cafes and small coffee businesses to set up business profiles: In this section, we would ask cafes and roasters 
 to provide information about the origins of their beans and products, and if they are: organic, fairtrade, sustainably sourced, local business, etc. and 
 showcase most popular menu items or weekly/daily specials. 
 We would also like to provide an opportunity for businesses to post surveys for potential coffee lovers using the app
 to answer questions about what kind of changes or products they would like to see that business do or provide.
 
  Additional pages: 
  A mini guide to coffee tasting and food pairing that provides users with a short guide to roast flavors and what foods 
  they pair well with (I have a lot of info about this from working at Starbucks and Teavana). Plus, a randomly generated daily suggestion
  of coffee to try either from stored user reviews and check-ins, or from an open API for coffee beans and roasts/cafes (if I can find one). 
  
  A mini guide to what it means for a product to be ethically sourced/fairtrade, sustainably farmed, etc. with links to coffee beans and cafes
  that have been tagged with those features. 
  
  A feature to search for coffee products and cafes by location, roast, business practices, etc. 
 
                   
                    
                  
### Technologies
Open API for coffee beans *if it exists* 
Google Maps plug in
MySQL/MySQL Lite (for storing reviews and tags)
Java (for forms, tags for business practices)
JavaScript (for points system, forms)
HTML
CSS
C#
Oauth (for user login)
I do have a tutorial for how to build a photo album page with CSS Grids, so maybe we can implement 
this in a gallery page or something of most recent user posts, or within the user review widget front-end. 

### What I'll Have to Learn
Where I can find a useable widget for the star-rating system. 

How to produce the back-end tied to our rewards/badge system (this might be beyond the scope of the class, but I am open
to trying because it was something Sarah really wanted to do). 

Need to find an Open API for the randomly generated coffee bean recommendation (I would prefer to find something with 
different kinds of beans from around the world, as that would be a fun way for users to learn about diversity and smaller ethical companies who 
ship around the world). 

Oauth 

How to build forms for users to upload profile photos (I am concerned, though, this might be beyond the scope of what my computer memory can store)

How to include Google Maps into our projects and get the reviews onto the check-in tags.
